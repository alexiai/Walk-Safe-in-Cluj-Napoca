# 🚶‍♂️ Walk Safe in Cluj-Napoca

**Walk Safe** is an innovative smart city application developed during a university hackathon. Its mission is to improve **pedestrian safety** and **environmental awareness** by guiding users through the safest, cleanest, and most well-lit walking routes across **Cluj-Napoca**.

---

## 📌 Overview

The app offers:

✅ **Custom pedestrian routes** based on:
- Traffic density
- Air pollution levels
- Street lighting
- Urban green coverage (vegetation)

🌐 **Integration with APIs** for:
- Real-time bus tracking
- Geolocation and reverse geocoding
- OpenLayers for interactive maps

🙌 **Social features**:
- Users can report new safe/unsafe areas to help improve the map
